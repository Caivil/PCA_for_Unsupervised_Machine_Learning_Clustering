# Principal-Component-Analysis ðŸ§®  
## ðŸ§¬ RNA-Seq data Analysis of *E. coli* bacteria Under Antibiotic Treatment

This repository contains a R script that processes an RNA-seq counts matrix and applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**â€”an unsupervised machine learning techniqueâ€”for dimensionality reduction. The goal is to visualize natural clustering patterns among *E. coli* samples treated with 17 different antibiotics and to reduce the complexity of the gene expression data.

This approach highlights how machine learning can uncover underlying pharmacological patterns in microbial responses, aiding **drug discovery** and **mechanism-of-action (MoA)** exploration.

The analysis is extended using supervised learning methods in Python (e.g., **Random Forest**) to predict the MoA, evaluating how effectively the model can classify antibiotics based on their gene expression profiles.
